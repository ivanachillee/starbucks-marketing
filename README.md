# Starbucks Marketing: The statistics of coffee transactions.
We all love coffee, right? That's why a lot of people use Starbucks Rewards, the Starbucks program that earns you benefits with your purchases, but it goes beyond that: customer spending descriptive statistics, offer analysis & optimisation, demographical clustering, and purchase prediction. The data science behind customer spending and loyalty programs. All of those things are included in this project.

## Overview
This project makes use of the [Starbucks App Customer Rewards Program Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/blacktile/starbucks-app-customer-reward-program-data) made available by Starbucks. Data cleaning, preprocessing, dimensional merges, deep EDA, and predictive modelling have been combined in order to develop this project.
