# Starbucks Marketing: The statistics of coffee transactions.
The Starbucks Rewards Program is the signature loyalty program of Starbucks, it comes with a card, an app, and plenty of special offers ready to be taken by their most loyal customers who are ready to pay what it gets to get their daily warm coffee. A portion of the Starbucks Rewards dataset has been released to the public so it can be freely explored, analysed and modelled.

## Overview
This project makes use of the [Starbucks App Customer Rewards Program Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/blacktile/starbucks-app-customer-reward-program-data) to analyse how each special offer made by Starbucks impacts different segments of their customer base, clustered by age, gender, and income; classify and measure transaction volumes across these variables and groups; and make use of predictive classification modelling in order to determine which offers are likely to succeed or not, giving room to different applications such as simulation playgrounds, user-specific offer creation, general offer fine-tuning, among other different ranges of model usability.
